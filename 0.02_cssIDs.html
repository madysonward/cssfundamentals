	<h1>IDs</h1>
	<p>An ID is a unique identifier.</p>
	<div>
		<h3>ID Notes</h3>
		<ul class="customClass">
			<li id="customId">It's unique to the element that it's on.</li>
			<li>To target it from our CSS, we need to use a # sign. Ex: #customId instead of .customId</li>
			<li>You can use them with classes on the same elements!</li>
			<li>IDs are most commonly used with JavaScript, rather than classes.</li>
			<li>If you have a class, and an ID on the same element, the ID will take priority over the class.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<h5>Challenge: Code the following.</h5>
	<h1>IDs</h1>
	<p>An ID is a unique identifier.</p>
	<div>
		<h3>ID Notes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Start with a pound/hashtag - #</li>
			<li>Uses: Header or an About Section</li>
			<li>Should only be used once per page...they are unique! This is very important to remember with jQuery later on.</li>
			<li>Use for one (and only one!) off styling.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<h1>IDs versus Classes</h1>
	<h2>IDs</h2>
	<p id="number-one">This ID will be linked in the CSS page by a #</p>
	<p id="number-one number-two">You can't have two IDs in an element.</p>

	<h2>Classes</h2>
	<p class="first-class">One class here.</p>
	<p class="first-class second-class">Two classes here.</p>

	<p id="number-one">You CAN use an ID twice, BUT it's best NOT to. It should be used mostly for targeting specific items.</p>
